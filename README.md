## Overview
This project was developed as part of **COMP 4304 â€“ Data Visualization** at Memorial University.

The goal was to create a compelling data story about artificial satellites in orbit, using the **General Catalog of Artificial Space Objects (GCAT)** dataset curated by Jonathan McDowell. The final deliverables included:

- âœ… A **large-format infographic** (36Ã—24 inches) designed for public display.
- âœ… An **interactive dashboard** built with Python for data exploration.

## Key Features

### Infographic (Static Visualization)
- Created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Highlights:
  - Growth of private-sector satellites post-2015
  - Country-wise launch dominance (USA, China, Russia)
  - Historical spikes during the space race, Cold War, and commercial booms
- Designed for general public display and understanding

### Interactive Dashboard
- Built using **ipywidgets** and deployed via **Voila**
- Enables interactive exploration of:
  - Satellite purposes (Communication, Navigation, Military, etc.)
  - Launch counts by country and decade
  - Trends across orbital types and nations
- Includes dropdowns, sliders, and filters

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.11
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- ipywidgets, Voila

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Applied storytelling principles in scientific communication
- Built high-quality static and interactive visualizations from raw datasets
- Practiced full-cycle data storytelling: from data cleaning â†’ visual design â†’ interactivity
- Focused on clarity, accessibility, and interpretability for public audiences
